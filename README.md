# 10STCA_ESPNOW_BME280

Students are required to work in groups of two to complete the following tasks:

Measure temperature using the BME280 sensor on an ESP-32
transmit temperature data wirelessly using the ESP-NOW protocol to the teacher's base module
Submission requirements:

Groups are required to demonstrate their ability in sending the correct data in the correct format (a string sending "ESP1" if you are group 1, and a float for temperature) to the teacher's module. The teacher must then review the group's code

Groups will be assessed on their ability to work independently as a group, and their ability to complete the task. High performing students will demonstrate excellent coding practices.
